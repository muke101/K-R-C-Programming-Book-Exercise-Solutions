The K&R (Kernighan and Richtie) C Programming Language book explains in detail how the language works by the creators themselves. It has a number of exercies to complete throughout every chapter, and I've submitted the ones I've currently got up to here as I read along. 

At the top of every file is the exercise description to explain what the code is doing. All exercies from every chapter previous to the one I'm currently reading have been completed, saving a few of the first ones in Chapter 1.
